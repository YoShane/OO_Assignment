    Hello, my name is YOU SHENG, CHEN. You can call me “Shane” and it represents
a shining and outstanding person. This name is from my English teacher’s expectations to
me and I like it so much. In fact, I am curious about many things and have good
observation ability.

    My interests are cycling and jogging. Especially enjoy the moment of riding the
bicycle with my friends. In addition, we sometimes challenge goals, maybe a mountain or
cycling for a far distance and have memorable memories.
I’m good at computer-related ability, such as computer programming, computer
assembling, repair computer and more, and welcome to ask me questions! I’m glad to
solve 3C problems for others.

    I study at Taiwan National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, First
Campus, learning about information management skills. The school education resources
are rich, it provides multicultural teaching and a comfortable environment for learning. I
have been a cooperative and obedient student in my teacher's eyes, and I think it’s my
concern for others that makes me popular.

    In the near future, I hope I have an opportunity to develop my interest and abilities
here. I believe I can bring my professional field into my career.
